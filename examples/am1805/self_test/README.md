# Example for `am1805` driver

## What it does

This example tests most of the implemented functionality.
Most importantly, is tests setting and getting the time of the RTC.
It also checks if the hour mode setting (12h/24h) works correctly.

## Wiring

Connect `SCL` and `SDA` pins to the following pins with appropriate pull-up
resistors.

| Name | Description | Defaults |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `CONFIG_EXAMPLE_I2C_MASTER_SCL` | GPIO number for `SCL` | "5" for `esp8266`, "6" for `esp32c3`, "19" for `esp32`, `esp32s2`, and `esp32s3` |
| `CONFIG_EXAMPLE_I2C_MASTER_SDA` | GPIO number for `SDA` | "4" for `esp8266`, "5" for `esp32c3`, "18" for `esp32`, `esp32s2`, and `esp32s3` |
